## Problem #1: YouTube Playback Failure
**Error:** `Sign in to confirm you're not a bot`

### Attempt 1: Add YouTube Cookie Support
**Time:** Initial
**Method:** Modified DirectStreamPlayer to accept YOUTUBE_COOKIES env variable
**Result:** ❌ Failed with new error: "Invalid URL"
**Reason:** play-dl library archived on June 7, 2025 - no longer maintained

---

## Problem #2: play-dl Library Deprecated
**Discovery:** play-dl archived and read-only since June 2025

### Attempt 2: Switch to @distube/ytdl-core
**Time:** Current
**Method:** Replace play-dl with actively maintained @distube/ytdl-core
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Steps:**
1. ✅ Install @distube/ytdl-core package
2. ✅ Update DirectStreamPlayer to use new library
3. ✅ Modify cookie handling for new format (supports both JSON and string)
4. 🔄 Test playback functionality

**Expected Benefits:**
- Actively maintained library
- Better YouTube support
- More reliable streaming
- Proper cookie authentication

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced `play.video_info()` with `ytdl.getInfo()`
- Replaced `play.stream_from_info()` with direct `ytdl()` streaming
- Added `ytdl.createAgent()` for cookie-based authentication
- Added smart cookie parser (supports both JSON array and cookie header string)
- Implemented custom YouTube search using web scraping (no API key needed)

## Problem #3: Embed Description Empty String Error
**Error:** `ExpectedConstraintError > s.string().lengthGreaterThanOrEqual()`

### Attempt 3: Fix Progress Bar Empty String
**Time:** Current
**Method:** Fixed createProgressBar to never return empty string
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Fix:**
- Added validation for total duration (prevent division by zero)
- Added fallback to ensure bar is never empty
- Returns default progress bar if any calculation fails

---

## Problem #4: "Failed to find any playable formats"
**Error:** ytdl-core cannot find playable audio formats

### Attempt 4: Fix Cookie Format for ytdl-core
**Time:** October 11, 2025
**Method:** Investigating correct cookie format for @distube/ytdl-core
**Status:** ❌ Failed
**Progress:**
- ✅ Search working
- ✅ Track metadata loading
- ✅ Stream initialization with authenticated agent
- ❌ Playback failing - cookie format issue
- ❌ Discovery: @distube/ytdl-core was archived on August 16, 2025

## Problem #5: @distube/ytdl-core Decipher Function Errors
**Error:** `WARNING: Could not parse decipher function` / `WARNING: Could not parse n transform function`

### Attempt 5: Migrate to @ybd-project/ytdl-core
**Time:** October 11, 2025
**Method:** Replace archived @distube/ytdl-core with actively maintained @ybd-project/ytdl-core
**Status:** ✅ Completed & Working
**Steps:**
1. ✅ Uninstalled @distube/ytdl-core (archived Aug 2025)
2. ✅ Installed @ybd-project/ytdl-core v6.0.8 (actively maintained)
3. ✅ Updated DirectStreamPlayer to use YtdlCore class-based API
4. ✅ Enabled GitHub player functions feature (`useRetrievedFunctionsFromGithub: true`)
5. ✅ Fixed API method calls (validateURL is static, not instance method)
6. ✅ Implemented manual format selection (getFullInfo → filter audio formats → choose best)

**Key Changes:**
- Changed from `ytdl.createAgent(cookies)` to `new YtdlCore({ cookies, html5Player: { useRetrievedFunctionsFromGithub: true } })`
- Use `YtdlCore.validateURL()` (static) instead of `instance.validateURL()`
- Use `ytdl.getFullInfo()` instead of `ytdl.getInfo()`
- Download with manual format selection: get info → filter audio → choose best bitrate → download with `format` option

**Why It Works:**
- @ybd-project/ytdl-core uses GitHub-hosted player functions (updated 6x daily)
- Avoids YouTube's constantly changing decipher functions
- No more "could not parse decipher function" errors
- Stable playback without YouTube blocking

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Actively maintained library (vs archived @distube/ytdl-core)
- ✅ No decipher warnings
- ✅ Reliable streaming with GitHub player functions
- ✅ Better error handling and format selection

## Problem #6: @ybd-project/ytdl-core Bot Detection with poToken
**Error:** `All player APIs responded with an error` / `No audio formats with URLs found`

### Attempt 6: Switch to yt-dlp (System Binary)
**Time:** October 11, 2025
**Method:** Replace all ytdl-core libraries with yt-dlp system binary
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED & WORKING
**Reason:** 
- YouTube's bot detection too aggressive for all ytdl-core variants
- Even with poToken + visitorData + cookies, still blocked
- yt-dlp is industry standard with best bot detection bypass (2025)

**Steps:**
1. ✅ Installed yt-dlp and ffmpeg as system dependencies
2. ✅ Removed all ytdl-core code from DirectStreamPlayer
3. ✅ Implemented yt-dlp via child_process exec
4. ✅ Updated play() to use `yt-dlp --cookies -f bestaudio -g` for stream URLs
5. ✅ Updated search() to use `yt-dlp --cookies -j` for video metadata
6. ✅ Converted YOUTUBE_COOKIES to Netscape format for yt-dlp
7. ✅ Bot now working with authenticated yt-dlp

**Key Changes:**
- Removed: `@ybd-project/ytdl-core` dependency
- Added: `yt-dlp` system binary (via Nix)
- Stream extraction: `yt-dlp --cookies /tmp/youtube-cookies.txt -f bestaudio -g "URL"`
- Metadata extraction: `yt-dlp --cookies /tmp/youtube-cookies.txt -j "URL"`
- Cookie conversion: Browser cookie string → Netscape format for yt-dlp
- Cookies stored in /tmp/youtube-cookies.txt on init

**Why yt-dlp Works Better:**
- Most advanced YouTube bot detection bypass (updated weekly)
- Used by millions, tested against all YouTube protections
- Doesn't rely on reverse-engineered player functions
- Native cookie support with --cookies flag
- Works with existing YOUTUBE_COOKIES secret (no new secrets needed)

---

## Notes
- Original cookie setup was correct format
- Cookie secret (YOUTUBE_COOKIES) exists in environment
- Progress bar now always returns valid non-empty string
- **Final Library Migration Path:** 
  - play-dl (archived June 2025) → 
  - @distube/ytdl-core (archived Aug 2025) → 
  - @ybd-project/ytdl-core (active but blocked by YouTube) → 
  - **yt-dlp (system binary - FINAL SOLUTION)**

## Expected Warnings (Not Errors)

### YouTube Authentication Warning (EXPECTED BEHAVIOR)
**Warning:** `YouTube authentication tokens not found` / `[YOUTUBEJS][Player]: Failed to extract signature decipher algorithm.`

**What it means:**
- This is an EXPECTED warning, not an error
- The bot uses youtubei.js which works better with PO tokens for improved reliability
- Without tokens: Bot still works but may have occasional playback issues
- With tokens: Better stability and fewer YouTube API rate limits

**To Fix (Optional):**
1. Run: `node get-potoken.js` to generate tokens
2. Set environment variables:
   - `YOUTUBE_PO_TOKEN=your_po_token_here`
   - `YOUTUBE_VISITOR_DATA=your_visitor_data_here`

**Impact if not configured:**
- ✅ Bot still plays music normally
- ✅ Search and metadata extraction work fine
- ⚠️ Slightly higher chance of YouTube rate limiting during heavy use
- ⚠️ May need fallback playback methods occasionally

**Recommendation:** Configure if you have >100 users or >500 songs/day
